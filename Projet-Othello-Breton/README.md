# OTHELLO

## About the game
Othello, known as Reversi, "is a strategy board game for two players, 
played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces 
called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on 
the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned 
color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in 
a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the 
current player's color are turned over to the current player's color." ref:
